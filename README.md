# TRS80M100_NEC8201A
TXTFOR.BA is a text formatting program for the NEC PC-8201A or TRS-80 Model 100.  It 
will take text that was entered using the TEXT program and format it per the dot commands
sending the output to the serial port (or a file if so desired).   The dot commands are
described in the TXTFOR_Documentation.pdf file.  This document was written on a NEC 8201A
and formatted by this program.  It was captured from a terminal program and printed to
a pdf.   The document demonstrates some of the features of this program including
fill, justification, tab stop (just one) and paragraph indenting (both positive and negative).
